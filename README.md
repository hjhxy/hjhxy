-👋 Hi, I 'm zxy and I' m looking forward to meeting a group of interesting, thoughtful people to do challenging things together.
-👀 I am very interested in coding.  I completed my undergraduate studies at Central South University of Forestry and Technology and am currently pursuing a master's degree at Shenzhen University.  Currently, I am interning in the Douyin Live streaming department of ByteDance.
-🌱 Source code of tools or frameworks that I am currently learning, such as whistle and React.  Meanwhile, I am also working on some interesting campus projects.  After completion, I will submit them to Github.
-💞️ During my undergraduate years, I interned at Internet companies such as ** Tencent ** and was officially hired.  Because I deeply felt that the technologies and ways of thinking I learned during my undergraduate studies were too superficial, I chose to pursue a master's degree in order to have more time to focus on the improvement of technologies and cognition.  I have strong hands-on ability, am highly motivated and have a strong curiosity about new things.
-📫 You can contact me at 3057472776@qq.com or 2410104004@email.szu.edu.cn.
