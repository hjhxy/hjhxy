- 👋 Hi, I’m zxy, I hope to meet a group of interesting and thoughtful people on github to do challenging things together.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding,I am from Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, I am in my first year as a graduate student. I am studying in **Central South University of Forestry and Technology** for my undergraduate degree and **Shenzhen University** for my postgraduate degree.
- 🌱 At present, I am studying the **source code of Whistle and React and other tools or frameworks**. At the same time, I am doing some **interesting campus projects**. Welcome to learn together!
- 💞️ During the undergraduate period, I worked as an intern in **Tencent** and other top Internet companies in China and got a formal offer of employment. Because I deeply felt that the technology I learned in my undergraduate studies was too shallow, I chose to go to graduate school in order to spend more time focusing on technology. With strong hands-on ability and self-drive, I have a strong curiosity for new things. I am currently building a personal blog, and I will put the link on the homepage when it is completed.
- 📫 You can **contact me** at 3057472776@qq.com or 2410104004@email.szu.edu.cn.
